# Visualizing Professor Quality In Specific Departments Across The UC System

## Introduction
Almost all high school students face a life changing decision during their senior year of high school: College. There’s a lot to take into consideration when choosing the right college and weighing your options. Though there are ranking systems online, when someone says “Berkeley has a good engineering program”, what does that mean? Specifically, what does that mean about the faculty? What do other students think about the engineering faculty? General ranking can’t help answer these questions. The data to find the answers are out there, but our project aims to bring all that data together in one place, and allow prospective students to make interpretations of it. 


We aim to scrape, analyze and visualize Rate My Professor ratings across all 9 UC schools. 
Our project has a few key goals:
1. Help prospective students compare faculty quality across UCs for their chosen major.
2. Visualize different patterns and trends in Professor ratings, difficulty levels, and student sentiment, among different departments
3. Create an application that allows users to interact with the data and see these visualizations.

We used Python, Selenium, Pandas and Plotly in order to collect and process our data from Rate My Professor. We ensured that professor names remained anonymous. We then took our data and analyzed it to create visualizations that would be useful for prospective students to see. Finally, we created an application that allows for users to interact with these visualizations so that they can be aided in their decision making process. In addition we conducted a sentiment analysis to understand how reviews and ratings are related.
