Tests are quite easy compared to math classes and they do reflect his lecture slides tbh"", ""He's the absolute worst. I took this class because he was teaching 2 sections of it and I figured it couldn't be all that bad. I was wrong. He is not available for questions, is a dry lecturer and the homework is 10% of your grade and a waste of time because it won't be on the midterm or final. Even his TAs didn't like his teaching method. AVOID"", ""A terrible teacher, and a terrible class. I'm usually an A student, and I couldn't keep up. Even though I did all of the homework, attended every lecture, I still failed the second midterm. His lectures are dull, the material is boring, and the examples make no sense. Save yourself the headache; stay away from this teacher!"", 'Worst teacher i have ever had at UCI. Examples in class are unclear. the book and homework do not go along with what he teaches at all. the exams look nothing like the examples. do not take his class if you have to take stats 7.', 'worst class i have ever taken. he is so hard to listen to, the book doesnt even go with his examples, he has powerpoints but never uploads the answers to the questions.. im a good student and ive failed the first two midterms. first two midterms and the final are 90% of your grade.. absolutely ridiculous. DO NOT TAKE', ""Don't take him if you're gonna take stats 120A because he teaches by the book and the book is HORRIBLE. Its full of weird examples that don't make sense. He is pretty nice, but that won't be enough to get a good grade."", ""Not a great professor. When I took the class there was no LARC session offered. This is not a good sign! The homework was easy and that's probably what helped me past the class. His tests are hard and his lectures aren't clear."", 'He seems to be a nice guy overall, but he has a lot of trouble explaining complex concepts to students who have never encountered them before.', ""He is probably the worst teacher I have had in a long time. Before the first test, I went to every lecture and I received a 46. Before the second test, I went to two lectures and received a 48. Clearly, attending lecture didn't really do too much. I only hope he curves the grades, otherwise I anticipate a lot of failing grades."", ""DO NOT TAKE WHATSOEVER. This class was horrible. Professor does not teach, but instead teaches you specific examples (i.e. The Reader's Digest Poll of 1936), gives easy homework, and then gives SUPER HARD tests that ask you nothing related to what you were taught at all. Professor is no help when you ask him, and the class isn't curved, either!"", ""this man takes delight in what he teaches. You can almost see his eyes light up. His speech is reasonably clear. The main issue is that his teaching notes things he finds interesting but does not to instill mastery. I'm now having to reteach myself concepts from 120b in 120c. 120b is far more advanced than 8 FYI. Practice MLE, MOM, and Lik ratios."", 'Dr. Phelan is a nice guy, intelligent, and charismatic. His class is hard and the concepts are not as straightforward as you would think. Do some studying on your own and go to office hours. Not my favorite class but had other reasons to come.', ""I don't particularly like Stats, but I found Professor Phelan funny and interesting. His material is hard, and although I was confused most of the time, I laughed alot. Even thought I got a B+, I enjoyed the class because he's funny. As for teaching, I'm sure there's an easier way to learn stats."", 'I am really surprised by all these negative reviews, math is not my thing and I did very well. His lecture examples/review problems posted online were almost exactly like the ones of the test. All it takes is a little bit of time to practice.', 'he just writes a bunch of formulas on the board, brings up R on the screen, and expects you to know what he is doing. he is not a good teacher.', 'Terrible teacher for this class. Unclear explanations, illegible writing. Simply refuses to go over the same material again- simply says ""it\'s in your notes"". Does nothing outside of his requirements- there were no study sessions or practice tests. If you miss a class, you\'re screwed on that material. Lazy, bad prof.', ""this is supposed to be an intro class. but what the heck, it's like harder than all the semester of calculus +linear algebra and diffEQ combined. Subject is not hard, his way of teaching makes it uber hard."", 'One of the worse teachers I have ever taken in college', 'hard professor, makes the material more confusing than it should be, writes really small on the board and sometimes is incomprehensible since he mumbles, his notes have more questions than answers. avoid this professor if you can..smart guy, but bad lecturer', 'This is probably the worst professor I have ever taken at UCI. His powerpoints are incomprehensible, filled with questions but not answers. He goes over them briefly in lecture but lectures are so confusing as well. His exams are mostly concept-based, which sucks because this is a STATS class and there should be more numbers.
